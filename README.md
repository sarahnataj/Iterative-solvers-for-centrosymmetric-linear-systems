Abstract: We derive structure–preserving LU–type factorizations for centrosymmetric matrice and use them for the numerical solution of linear systems. For direct solvers we build on and extend existing algorithms, and show that the factorizations along with equilibration and mixed precision arithmetic speed up the computation and increase the accuracy of the solution. For iterative solvers we develop structure–preservingmincomplete LU factorizations and use them as preconditioners for Krylov subspace solvers. We apply these solvers to centrosymmetric linear systems arising from spectral methods for the Poisson, diffusion, Helmholtz, and biharmonic equations in one, two, and three dimensions.
