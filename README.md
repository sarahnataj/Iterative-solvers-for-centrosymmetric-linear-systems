Abstract: We derive structure-preserving LU-type factorizations for centrosymmetric matrices and use them for the numerical solution of linear systems. For direct solvers we build on  existing algorithms, and complement the factorizations with equilibration and mixed precision arithmetic computations. For iterative solvers we develop structure-preserving incomplete LU-type factorizations and use them as preconditioners for Krylov subspace solvers. We apply these solvers to centrosymmetric and nearly-centrosymmetric linear systems arising from spectral methods for model problems involving the Poisson, diffusion, Helmholtz, and biharmonic equations in one, two, and three dimensions..
